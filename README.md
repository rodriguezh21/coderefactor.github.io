# Code Refactor Homework

## Accessibility is key!

The goal of this project was to refactor an existing website to meet a certain set of standards that would make it more accessible. I was able to track down non-working links, added alt text, and worked on the semantics of the site.

This project was a great opportunity to put some knowledge into practice and truly motivates me to keep working hard!
